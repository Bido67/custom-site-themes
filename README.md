# Omnivox.ca retheme

This .css file contains my retheme of Omnivox.ca, A college web portal used in The Province of Québec for "Cégeps".

It's a quite old portal and is built in a such complex way that it is really hard to retheme it.

Its currently a work in progress as i need to document it / fix variables that are not located in the file, as i made a Settings stylus theme containing all my theme settings to keep them the same across all websites.
